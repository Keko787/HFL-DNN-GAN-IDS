"""Build a finite, natural-exit topology for one Experiment-4 trial.

EX-4.0 arm **H1**: 1 cluster + 1 mule + N devices, the mule capped at
``n_missions`` so the whole process tree exits on its own once the
missions are done (the driver then reads the JSONL logs). Devices are
placed in a tight cluster near the origin so the Four-Stage Gated
Scheduler's S3a range-clustering reliably forms at least one contact
event within ``rf_range_m`` — the point of EX-4.0 is to measure the real
two-pass path, not to stress contact formation (that is the sweep's job
once the plumbing is proven).

Positions are seeded off the trial's paired seed so the same
``(cell, trial_index)`` lays devices out identically across arms — the
paired-seed property the analysis relies on.
